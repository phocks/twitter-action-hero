# Twitter Action Hero

Use the Twitter API to do things.

*(A work in progress...)*

## Install and dev

Clone this repo and run `yarn install` then edit the code and run `yarn run dev`.

Use `dotenv` to set up twitter keys, importing them in index.ts and sending them to various actions as necessary.

Pull requests for different and interesting actions welcome.

## Build and use

Run `yarn run build` to transpile the TypeScript into a build dir.

Use [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) to run periodically on your system.
